# Bacterial Biodiversity
## About
A friend, let’s call her Roza, is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Roza’s role is to discover and document bacteria species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste and feel like meat. Her lab has partnered with a startup company that is trying to create a new formula for artificial beef. 
Roza wants to build dashboard that participants and fellow researchers can access. This interface would have a completed panel for demographic information as well as some visualization tools to display the bacteria colony data. This project will use the following to construct the site: D3 library, JavaScript, and HTML.
